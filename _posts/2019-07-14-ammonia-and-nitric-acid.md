# Work Log

## 15 Jul 2019
Attempted the synthesis. I won't be doing this again. Adding the sulfuric acid results in a lot of decomposition. The ammonia reaction didn't go to completion because there wasn't enough water. Better to pay the extra money and buy the nitrate and ammonium salts separately.

\begin{equation}
NH_{4}NO_{3} + NaOH \rightarrow NaNO_{3} + NH_{3} + 2H_{2}O \\
(NH_{3} + 2H_{2}O) + 2.15H_{2}O \rightarrow NH_{4}OH + 3.15H_{2}O \\
NaNO_{3} + \tfrac{1}{2} H_{2}SO_{4} \rightarrow \tfrac{1}{2} Na_{2}SO_{4} + HNO_{3}
\end{equation}

Starting from 180g ammonium nitrate (the contents of two ice packs) in 500mL flask:

- add 130.52g sodium hydroxide
- heat until all water has been removed; bubble the effluent through 90g distilled water
- add 70ml conc. sulfuric acid (slight excess)
- distill nitric acid at 83&#176;C
- yields: 38g ammonia as 128g (142ml) 30% $NH_{4}OH$ (80g $NH_{4}OH$ ); 70g (46ml) nitric acid

$NaOH$ is probably the monohydrate form. Would that be enough water to dry mix the ingredients and distill the ammonia?
