# Intro
The idea here is to make sodium using deep eutectic solvents to catalyze the reaction between magnesium and sodium hydroxide (chloride?) or electrolyze a sodium salt. No tertiary alcohol catalysts or exotic solvents required.

- Choline chloride:zinc chloride seems to be a suitable DES
    - both have to be purchased online
- solubilities are not that great, but that may not be a problem if you are going with the Mg/NaOH route
- Mostly based on the research from [@bagh_ionic_2014]
- DES's have the advantage of reusability and low vapor pressure
- Might face the same problems that NurdRage was having in his sodium production due to water contamination
