  The GRE general test is one of the objective requirements for my application to grad school. I took the test once before and performed "adequately". This time, I shall actually spend time preparing and hopefully attain a better score.

# GRE Premier 2017 with six practice tests
Review in three sections. One section for each part of this book.

## Part One: Getting Started
Part one covers the basic testing characteristics of the GRE: How it is set up, and how it is scored.

### Ch. 1 Introduction to the GRE
The GRE has three section: Verbal Reasoning, Quantitative Reasoning, and Analytical Writing. Each section has its own testing methodology which is discussed in detail in the following sections.

### Ch. 2 Multi-Stage Test Mechanics
The Multi-Stage test adaptively controls the difficulty level of the second test in each section. The better a test taker performs on the first section, the greater their score potential will be. This effectively provides a score floor/ceiling based upon the first test of each section. The effects of the Multi-Stage test are not known to the test taker, therefore, it is best to simply ignore this information when it comes to taking the test.

I loaded cards from [Barron's GRE words][]. I then deleted all the words I knew well.
