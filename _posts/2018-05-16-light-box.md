# Work Log

## 16 May 2018
Built a quick foam cutter out of old toaster nichrome and some bits of wood. The power was adjusted manually using an alligator clip.

Polypropylene foam was stretched over the foam forms and attached using hot glue and sewing pins.

Magnetic strip tape was used to line the edges so the whole thing could be disassembled and stored away. I certainly don't have and extra 4 cubic feet to just have this thing sitting on my desk all the time...
