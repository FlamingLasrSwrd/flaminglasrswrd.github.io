# Work Log

## 06 Oct
2nd generation grain for Lion's mane and reishi jars. I started three of each and only had time to transfer one of each. The two jars of militaris has yet to reach 100% coverage.

One Lion's mane jar had contamination. Considering my success rate with agar lately, I don't believe it was my technique.

I am not going to have the space to grow all of these jars out. Guess they will have to be Christmas presents or something.

## 28 Sep 2020
Started Lion's Mane, Reishi, and C. militaris grain masters from LC. Standard no-rinse, no-soak oat prep.

I attempted to resurrect some old Shiitake and Oyster LCs on agar. No such luck. I guess 4 years is just too old.

Studying the various process techniques and grains for spawn production.

### Process Variables
- Rinse
- Soak
- Sterilization times
- Sterilization temperatures

### Grains
- Wheat
      - hard winter red
      - gold
      - bulk
- Rye
- Millet (sorghum)
      - popping
      - gold
- Economy Bird Seed mix
- Popcorn
- Sunflower seeds
- Oats

### Grain Characteristics
- As packaged
      - density
      - moisture content
      - roughage percentage
      - "floaters" percentage
- 24 hour soak
    - density
    - moisture content
    - bursting percentage
- Contamination frequency

## 05 Jan 2019
- volatile organic compounds that inhibit pinning and fruiting [@noble_volatile_2009]

## 04 Jan 2019

### Investigating local substrates and supplements
I'm looking into vitamin and mineral supplementation.
- What about formulated feed pellets with amendments?
    - [Producers Pride 12%](https://www.tractorsupply.com/tsc/product/producers-pride-12-horse-pellet-50-lb?cm_vc=-10005)
- SSF in tubes and extension rates for various substrate mixtures would be ideal [@philippoussis_agro-food_2015]
- Gathering some other data on productivity besides just growth rate and BE?
    - crude protein, fat, carbohydrate assays?
    - C/N ratio
    - ash
    - water content

### What to select for?
- Ultimately appearance and fresh weight are primary factors affecting sale price (labeling may also contribute)
    - profit is based mainly on product weight per unit time less labor and substrate costs
- Labeling: variations on how 'Local' [@burnett_consumer_2011]
- Price Premiums: Local; Organic; Carbon-Footprint; [@onozaka_does_2011]


## 29 Dec 2018
Started research collection on ideal substrate formulas.
