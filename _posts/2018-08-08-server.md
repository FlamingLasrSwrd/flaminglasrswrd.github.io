# Introduction
I was getting tired of rigging my old Ubuntu 16.04 desktop-turned server. So I decided to spend a few dollars and buy some old (circa 2012) server hardware.

I use this server mainly for python and web development. It also has some general purpose file storage for backups and such.

# Basic Setup
Throughout this page I will refer to two physical computers: my laptop and the server. The server is located at `192.168.1.10` and my laptop at `192.168.1.2`. My laptop runs Ubuntu 16.04. For the installation of Ubuntu server 18.04 on my server, I hook up a temporary monitor with a spare GPU. Otherwise, the server runs headless with access only via SSH and only using my key. I set the non-root sudo user as `user` and the server hostname as `host`. Change these as you see fit.

Install Ubuntu server as usual by following the on-screen directions. I opted to automatically install security updates and use an encrypted LVM. I also checked to box to install OpenSSH.

The new Ubuntu installer does not include encrypted drives so you will need to grab an alternate image [here](http://cdimage.ubuntu.com/releases/18.04/release/). This isn't necessary, I just prefer whole disk encryption. **NOTE:** you will have to enter the decryption password on every reboot. This is especially difficult for a headless system. Enable encryption only if you are super paranoid and don't mind being physically present for every reboot.

After the fresh install of with encrypted LVM and OpenSSH:
```bash
sudo apt update
sudo apt dist-upgrade
```
Enable firewall:
```bash
sudo ufw allow in openSSH
sudo ufw enable
```
Set static IP (replace the interface name and ip addresses for your system):
```bash
sudo nano /etc/netplan/01-netcfg.yaml
```
```bash
network:
  version: 2
  renderer: networkd
  ethernets:
    enp1s0f0:
      dhcp4: no
      dhcp6: no
      addresses: [192.168.1.10/24, ]
      gateway4: 192.168.1.1
      nameservers:
        addresses: [192.168.1.1,8.8.8.8,1.1.1.1]
```
```bash
sudo netplan apply
sudo reboot
```
You will need to log in again to the new ip address.
To install the python 3.6 version of anaconda (**not miniconda**) and set up python environments:
```bash
wget https://repo.anaconda.com/archive/Anaconda3-5.2.0-Linux-x86_64.sh
chmod +x Anaconda3-5.2.0-Linux-x86_64.sh
bash Anaconda3-5.2.0-Linux-x86_64.sh
```
Answer the questions as you see fit. I went with the default user installation.
Set up py36 and py27 environments:
```bash
conda update conda
conda create --name py36 python=3.6
conda create --name py27 python=2.7
source activate py36
pip install --upgrade pip
source activate py27
pip install --upgrade pip
source deactivate
```
I wanted to only allow ssh key logins from my laptop. **From my laptop terminal window**:
```bash
ssh-copy-id [SERVER_USERNAME]@[SERVER_IP_ADDRESS]
```
Now ssh into the server again and modify the ssh config file:
```bash
sudo nano /etc/ssh/sshd_config
```
Uncomment the line ```PasswordAuthentication yes``` and change it to:
```bash
PasswordAuthentication no
```
Exit and write your changes. Then restart ssh:
```bash
sudo systemctl restart ssh
```
Log out and log back in to make sure everything works:
```bash
exit
ssh [SERVER_USERNAME]@[SERVER_IP_ADDRESS]
```
I also wanted a few services:
```bash
sudo apt update
sudo apt install python-dev python3-dev build-essential git
sudo mysql_secure_installation
```
I also activated live-patch kernel updates by following [these instructions](https://ubuntu.com/livepatch). Best to be safe with Spectre and Meltdown so close in recent memory.
```bash
sudo snap install canonical-livepatch
sudo canonical-livepatch enable [LIVEPATCH-KEY]
```

And reboot just for good measure:
```bash
sudo reboot
```

# RabbitMQ
The best way to install RabbitMQ is to follow [the instructions to add the PPA](https://www.rabbitmq.com/install-debian.html#apt). For the impatient:
```bash
wget -O - 'https://dl.bintray.com/rabbitmq/Keys/rabbitmq-release-signing-key.asc' | sudo apt-key add -
echo "deb https://dl.bintray.com/rabbitmq/debian bionic main" | sudo tee /etc/apt/sources.list.d/bintray.rabbitmq.list
sudo apt update
sudo apt install rabbitmq-server
sudo service rabbitmq-server start
```
If you are running Uncomplicated Firewall (you should be), you can create an app profile:
```bash
sudo nano /etc/ufw/applications.d/rabbitmq-server
```
```bash
[RabbitMQ]
title=An open source message broker.
description=A lightweight and easy to deploy message broker from rabbitmq.com.
ports=4369,5671:5672,25672,35672:35682,15672/tcp
```
Then allow it in UFW:
```bash
sudo ufw app update RabbitMQ
sudo ufw allow RabbitMQ
```
Port 15672/tcp is only needed if you want the web UI:
```bash
sudo rabbitmq-plugins enable rabbitmq_management
sudo service rabbitmq-server restart
```
By default the user *guest* can only access the web UI on *localhost*, so we have to create admin user with better security:
```bash
sudo rabbitmqctl add_user [USERNAME] [PASSWORD]
sudo rabbitmqctl set_user_tags [USERNAME] administrator
sudo rabbitmqctl set_permissions -p / [USERNAME] ".*" ".*" ".*"
```
It's best to delete the guest account:
```bash
sudo rabbitmqctl delete_user guest
```
You should now be able to access the UI at ```http://[SERVER_IP_ADDRESS]:15672``` using the newly created account.

Enable rabbitmq at startup:
```bash
sudo systemctl enable rabbitmq-server
```
It would probably be better to only allow admin to work on *localhost* and create a separate user for other work, but that's for another day.

# Self-Signed Certificate

# Setting up NuPIC
[NuPIC](https://github.com/numenta/nupic)) is one of my favorite AIs at the moment. It takes a little bit of work to get it running, however.

Just in case you didn't do the above setup, here's what's needed from a fresh install of ubuntu server 18.04:
```bash
sudo apt update
sudo apt upgrade
sudo apt install build-essential python-dev mysql-server git
sudo mysql_secure_installation
```
Assuming you are using anaconda:
```bash
conda create --name nupic python=2.7
source activate nupic
pip install --upgrade pip
pip install nupic
```
I also like to have the nupic repo to run tests and such:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/numenta/nupic.git
```
If you chose to set a root password (you should), then the default config for nupic will not work. You could give nupic admin privileges under the root login or you can create a new user called nupic. After logging into your mysql server as root ```sudo mysql```:
```MySQL
CREATE DATABASE nupic;
CREATE USER 'nupic'@'localhost' IDENTIFIED BY 'nupic';
GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON nupic.* TO 'nupic'@'localhost';
```
Repetitive I know. Set the username, password, and database to whatever you want.
Now we must update the nupic config to match the mysql login we just created:
```bash
nano ~/anaconda3/envs/nupic/lib/python2.7/site-packages/nupic-1.0.6.dev0-py2.7.egg/nupic/support/nupic-default.xml
```
Change the ```nupic.cluster.database.user``` variable to your new mysql user:
```bash
<property>
  <name>nupic.cluster.database.user</name>
  <value>nupic</value>
  <description>Username for the MySQL database server </description>
</property>
```
And change the ```nupic.cluster.database.passwd``` variable to your new password:
```bash
<property>
  <name>nupic.cluster.database.passwd</name>
  <value>nupic</value>
  <description>Password for the MySQL database server </description>
</property>
```
And that's it. You should have a running nupic setup. You can run the unit tests:
```bash
cd ~/nupic/
py.test tests/unit
```

# WebDAV
My Zotero account far exceeds their built in cloud file storage. I could pay Zotero for extra storage (which I hope to do when I have money), or I can set up a WebDAV server myself.
I followed [this instruction set from DigitalOcean](https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/how-to-configure-webdav-access-with-apache-on-ubuntu-14-04). For the lazy:
Install the necessary components:
```bash
sudo apt install apache2 apache2-utils
sudo a2enmod dav
sudo a2enmod dav_fs
sudo a2enmod auth_digest
```
Open ports in UFW:
```bash
sudo ufw allow in apache
```
Create webdav directory and update permission:
```bash
sudo mkdir /var/www/webdav
sudo chown -R www-data:www-data /var/www/
```
Create a webdav user called zotero and update permissions (enter a good password at the prompt):
```bash
sudo htdigest -c /etc/apache2/users.password webdav zotero
sudo chown www-data:www-data /etc/apache2/users.password
```
Modify the apache2 config at ```sudo nano /etc/apache2/sites-available/000-default.conf
``` to serve the webdav folder by adding this to the ```<VirtualHost> section:```
```bash
# WebDAV
Alias /webdav /var/www/webdav
<Directory /var/www/webdav/>
        DAV On
        AuthType Digest
        AuthName "webdav"
        AuthUserFile /etc/apache2/users.password
        Require valid-user
</Directory>
```
As well as
```bash
DavLockDB /var/www/DavLock
```
to the first line of the file.

Zotero requires a folder called zotero in the webdav directory. Also, a Zotero library can get pretty large, so I'm creating a symlink to a non-system disk mounted at ```/media/2TB/``` with more space:
```bash
sudo ln -s /media/2TB/media/zotero /var/www/webdav/zotero
```
You probably could make the changes in the apache2 config file, but that would require different permission on my disk, which I don't want to do.

Restart to update all the changes:
```
sudo service apache2 restart
```
You should be able to access your WebDAV at ```http://[SERVER_IP_ADDRESS]/webdav/``` with the username and password set earlier.
Zotero Settings:
Edit -> Preferences -> Sync -> File Sync -> Sync Attachment files in My Library using [WebDAV]

Later I will update WebDAV to work over SSL, but this isn't strictly necessary. I don't use the WebDAV for anything other than zotero and all that info is public anyway. Your webdav password will be sent in clear-text so don't reuse a password (you shouldn't be doing that anyway).

# Plex Media Server
I followed [these instructions](https://linuxize.com/post/how-to-install-plex-media-server-on-ubuntu-18-04/) pretty much to the letter, so I won't repost them here.
In order to play some of the files I also installed vlc ```sudo apt install vlc```. It was easier than tracking down all the necessary codecs one-by-one.

# MongoDB
I follow [these instructions](https://websiteforstudents.com/install-mongodb-on-ubuntu-18-04-lts-beta-server/) almost verbatim. The only change I made was to add a profile for UFW ```sudo nano /etc/ufw/applications.d/mongod```:
```bash
[mongodb]
title=NoSQL database program
description=A free and open-source cross-platform document-oriented database program.
ports=27017/tcp
```
```bash
sudo ufw allow in mongodb
```

# Factorio Headless Server
Download a copy of the [Factorio headless image](https://www.factorio.com/download-headless).

# Torrent Server
I want to be able to share some large files. In all likelihood, only a few downloads will ever happen, so I think a torrent server would be appropriate. Unfortunately, my favorite torrent client, Transmission, does not have a built in tracker, so I am forced to use qBittorrent.
My server is headless, so I'm following [these installation instructions](https://github.com/qbittorrent/qBittorrent/wiki/Setting-up-qBittorrent-on-Ubuntu-server-as-daemon-with-Web-interface-%2815.04-and-newer%29) for the basic setup.
Then I need it to [act as a tracker](https://github.com/qbittorrent/qBittorrent/wiki/How-to-use-qBittorrent-as-a-tracker). Unfortunately, I couldn't get this to work even after several hours of fiddling. I resorted to using public trackers obtained [here](https://github.com/ngosang/trackerslist).

# Dynamic DNS
I've always had good luck with [noip.com][]. Normally I would install their [dynamic update client on the server](https://www.noip.com/support/knowledgebase/installing-the-linux-dynamic-update-client-on-ubuntu/), but I have found a better way. [Tomato](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tomato_(firmware)) has a setting for dynamic updates. Its as simple as adding your login info and hostname and clicking *save*.
