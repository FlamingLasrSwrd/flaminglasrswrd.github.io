# Ethanol

Ethanol can be dehydrogenated to ethanal (acetaldehyde) over a catalyst (typically copper) at high temperatures. Depending on the catalyst, other products such as ethyl acetate can be formed.

CH3CH2OH ->[Cu] CH3CHO + H2

# Methanol

Methanol can similarly be dehydrogenated to methanal (formaldehyde) over a catalyst (typically copper) at high temperatures.

CH3OH ->[Cu] CH2O + H2

Continuing with methanal. I made the copper impregnated carbon. Now I have to reduce it in-situ. I'm using aluminum + acid as my hydrogen generator. The acid is the semi-spent sulfuric and hydrochloric acid mix from the aluminum chloride synthesis. This mix is dripped **slowly** onto aluminum foil balls in a bit of water to retard the initial reaction.

I hope to get the hydrogen cell running soon so I can generate hydrogen on demand for cheap. Also, I have used just about every clamp and keck clip for this glass setup. I need some more...

For the initial run to decompose the copper nitrate (~170C), I vented the gasses directly out of the fume hood instead of leaving the bubbler in place. This is so I don't have nitric acid contamination of the (already filled) formaldehyde collector. After the nitrogen dioxide evolution has ceased, I will reconnect the bubbler to visually determine the hydrogen flow rate.

As a side note, it is very difficult to measure the temperature of a 1cm diameter glass tube with an IR thermometer. You have to align the beam just right to get a measurement that doesn't fluctuate wildly.

Well I'm stupid. I guess I didn't let the catalyst cool long enough before starting the hydrogen... I had to clean up 100+ml of acid explosion. I'm going to try again tomorrow this time with a CO2 purge for good measure.

Let's make some methanal! [@shelepova_synthesis_2017]

- 20g activated carbon
- 1g copper as copper nitrate formed from 1.74g basic copper carbonate & nitric acid (5% w/w loading)
- dry
- reduce with hydrogen at 450C for 2 hours

User jimmymajesty achieved excellent results by using air-oxidized copper plated nichrome wire in a ketene apparatus <http://www.sciencemadness.org/talk/viewthread.php?tid=55&goto=search&pid=176566>

- Investigating the production of mesoporous carbon catalysts.
- Carbon has high selectivity compared to silica, but it suffers from short lifespan. Copper sintering seems the issue. Lack of interaction with the base material is the cause. @wang_cu_2018
- Carbon can be deposited on silica supports with the layer of catalyst further deposited on that.
- Searching for a suitable mesoporous carbon precursor...
- Furfural alcohol might be ok since it can be made from agricultural byproducts and sulfuric acid followed by hydrogenation. @noauthor_furfural_1921
- Sucrose could work @bohme_templated_2005 @ryoo_synthesis_1999
- 52.5 kJ mol => 49 BTU; easily done with bunsen burner; heat loss is probably biggest problem
- chromite stabilization is another option but isn't good for the environment
- instead of mesoporous carbon... graphene? @morales_bioethanol_2016
- I haven't found anything on electrooxidation in DES
- As far as setup goes: something akin to [Doug's Lab Ketene Lamp](https://youtu.be/_1mMW2qEF84) but with a core of catalyst heated by resistance wire?

Isolating various metallic catalyst precursors:

- Nickel (US 5 cent piece)
    - available as [nickel carbonate colorant](https://digitalfire.com/4sight/material/nickel_carbonate_1073.html): better to buy because of toxicity issues with electrolyzing nickel compounds
- Barium
- Gold (from previous experiments)
- Platinums
    - probably best to buy it

### Nickel
Hmmm... Extracting nickel from nickels:

Attempts using a polypropylene fabric bag to hold the nickels.

Final method that simply uses a basket made from copper wire. The copper plates out of solution while the nickel stays dissolved.

### Barium

(rust converter) => **cheaper as [barium carbonate glaze](https://digitalfire.com/4sight/material/barium_carbonate_86.html)**
