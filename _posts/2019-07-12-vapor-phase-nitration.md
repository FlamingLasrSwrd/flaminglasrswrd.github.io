Indigo carmine might work as a sodium hydroxide indicator. At a pH below 11.6 it turns blue.

A microreactor would be ideal for the amateur. A few ml per hour is sufficient for us. Unfortunately, vapor nitration of alkanes proceeds via a free radical mechanism. Contact with reactor walls (made of stainless steel) extinguishes radicals resulting in single digit conversions. [@burns_microreactor_2002]

Microreactors at room temperature and relatively low pressure do work for nitrating toluene. [@halder_nitration_2007] The researchers basically pushed toluene and nitric acid through stainless or teflon capillary tubing. Even at room temperature and azeotropic nitric acid, decent yields were obtained. This could be a cool use of one of my extra HPLC pumps...

Discovered molten-salt reactors. Probably a much safer alternative to tubular reactors for the amateur. [@adams_vapor_1961]

In brief, the reactants are bubbled through a molten, eutectic mixture of nitrate salts. This provides better temperature control and even mixing.

Calcium nitrate is considerably cheaper than potassium or sodium. This is often sold as a double salt of calcium carbonate and ammonium nitrate, however. Ammonium nitrate decomposes around 200C, so this wouldn't work.

- nitrating ketones results in only 9-13% yield [@wang_preparation_1985-2]
- mercaptans are added to consumer hydrocarbons -could contaminate
    - contamination can be removed by bubbling through NaOH solution [@jones_mercaptans_2013]
    - below pH 12.5 efficiency falls below 80% (figure 7; pp 7)
- recycling the propane by scrubbing out CO/CO2? [@lamb_removal_1920]
    - oxidation might require mixed copper/manganese oxides [@hutchings_ambient_1996; @kramer_structural_2006]
