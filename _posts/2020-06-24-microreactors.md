# Work Log

## 10 Nov 2020
I've been constructing a test version of the microreactor using a few scavenged HPLC pumps. It consists of three inputs. Two are mixed together before the third is added. It is designed to be operated in a coolant bath.

Unfortunately, HPLC pumps are not perfect. They definitely can't be used for nitration studies.

Project Created!

I've probably looked through 30 eBay pages trying to find 1/16" stainless steel tubing. My acceptably small result list of 712 items from this eBay search string:

> SS tube -fitting -NPT -fittings -elbow -union -3/8 -1/2 -3/4 -5/8 -adapter -nut -clamp -connector -plug -gauge -MNPT -US -gauges -beer -sleeve

I was still looking for tee's and crosses so I left those in the search.

I finally stumbled across the Waters line of tubing for HPLC. The reason I didn't find it before is that Waters labels their tubing in thousands of an inch, not the customary fractions (e.g. 0.062" instead of 1/16").

Anyway, now I have a decent supply available of longer SS tubes that don't cost hundreds of dollars (for 50 meter increments).
