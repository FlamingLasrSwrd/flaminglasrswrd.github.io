# Work Log

## TODO

- [ ] design a better box

## 16 Feb 2019

A wall mounted box with continuously circulated chilled nutrient solution.
- submerged pump to circulate water
- drip irrigation
- peltier cooler to keep water temperature around 50F
- gravel media bed
- plastic liner - styrofoam insulator - wood casing
- plants can get quite large: 1-2 ft tall/wide
- planter box must be at least 1 ft deep (might be heavy)
- 12-18 months maturation time
- aquaponics... too complicated and limited options


- ideal water temperature is 54-59F
- pH 6.0-7.0
- E.C. between 0.03 and 0.2 milliohm per cm
- less than 0.1 ppm ammonia nitrogen and no nitrite-nitrogen
- 2 in sand -> 3 in gravel -> 16-40 in small rocks (3 in diameter)
- each plant requires at least 1/2 sq. ft.


> Phosphorus levels in this water range from 0.06 to 2.2 ppm, and potassium levels average between 2.0 and 3.0 ppm.
> 12-12-12 (N-P-K) is applied to the water at the rate of 0.02 pounds per square foot
> A foliar application of sulfur is sometimes made 1–3 months before harvest to enhance the flavor of wasabi.
> planting wasabi so that the crown of the plant is approximately ½ inch above the soil surface [@miles_growing_2008]
