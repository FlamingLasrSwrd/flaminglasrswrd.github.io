# Work Log
This is mostly for my benefit. Each day has a before and an after in which I reflect on the day as well as some metadata.

## Sunday, Aug 27, 2017 - Weekly Review
**Before:** Today is the day I plan my next three months to four years. My goal is to get into grad school next fall. How do I get there? What do I need to change? Lots of questions. Very few answers at the moment.  
**After:** Quite a few things were answered today. I looked into KU's research into AI and there basically isn't any. I need to prep for the GRE. The Dept of Linguistics has a 50th anniversary in a few weeks. That looks fun. I would like to find more colloquy to attend.  
**Time Spent:** 3 hrs

## Mon, Aug 28, 2017 - MOOCs
**Before:** Massive Open Online Courses will be the subject of today's research. I need to find some classes to start on. I could, of course, just learn these things on my own, but for a number of reasons MOOCs are better. Today's work will be cut short since I have to travel home at 3pm to return my brother's car.  
**After:** I spent way too much time with the car ordeal. I created the [MOOC][] page.  
**Time Spent:** 3 hrs

## Tue, Aug 29, 2017 - GRE
**Before:**
The GRE is a major contributor to my scholastic success and proof of such. How do I prepare? Last time I took it (2012) I did not prepare and I didn't do so well.  
**After:**
I found a workbook provided by Kaplan. I shall work through it and if I have time I will also work through an additional "Math Workout for the GRE" book. I also finished my research on MOOCs and decided that I must become proficient in Python before anything else. I spent some time on this site as well. I can't believe I still have all this stuff from previous projects.  
**Time Spent:** 8 hrs

## Wed, Aug 30, 2017 - Researchers
**Before:** The whole goal of grad school is to learn more about AI. I can start that research now and accomplish some of my grad application goals at the same time. Today I should focus on defining my research goals and finding some others who have the same.  
**After:** I think I am more confused. AI just isn't specific enough. I thought I would just be looking at CS programs, but now I have to look at cognitive and brain sciences too.  
**Time Spent:** 6 hrs

## Thu, Aug 30, 2017 - Website
**Before:** Need to work on the site. Its horrendous.  
**After:**  It's less horrendous.  
**Time Spent:** 6 hrs

## Sun, Sep 3, 2017 - Back on the Wagon
**Before:** I fell off the wagon. Let's get back to it. Over the weekend I did a few hours of work on the site and some AI work, but not very much. Mostly I spent time watching Youtube :( Today I would like to set up some structure to my days.  
**After:**
