# Purification of Hardware Store Chemicals
Many of these purifications have a drying step. Consult [this page](https://www.chem.ucla.edu/~bacher/Specialtopics/Drying%20Agents.html) before using any unnamed drying agent.

## Ethylene Glycol

EG is commonly available as the main ingredient of vehicle antifreeze. There are higher boiling glycol contaminants and nonvolatile corrosion inhibitors. Distill first at 197C. Then dry with magnesium or calcium sulfate and fractionally distill (under vacuum if you choose). The first 1-5% will be cloudy because of the water content and may be discarded.

## DCM

Unfortunately, dichloromethane isn't sold in OTC any more. Probably a good thing. It's really bad news.

DCM and methanol form an azeotrope at 37.8C (93% DCM).

DCM, especially from the hardware store, has methanol and water impurities. If this is your source, first separate the binders and thickeners by distillation in a water bath. Then wash the DCM/MeOH distillate with water and proceed as usual.

Add 10-20ml concentrated sulfuric acid per liter. Stir for a few hours. Decant. Wash with 5% bicarbonate solution and then distilled water to neutralize. Predry with CaCl2 (also removing trace MeOH). Distill over magnesium sulfate. Store in dark bottle over molecular sieves.

I still have a gallon of DCM-based paint stripper left from the old days. When I finish using it, I will likely move on to 2-Methyltetrahydrofuran or cyclepentyl methyl ether. In places where acceptable, I have already converted to using ethyl acetate, although EtOAc tends to be reactive or unstable.

## Hydrochloric Acid
HCl is commonly sold as "muriatic acid" for cleaning concrete. It is concentrated (32%) and full of metal chlorides.

Purification is done by distilling the azeotrope (20% HCl, bp 109C). To 300ml deionized water, add 500ml of commercial muriatic acid and distill.

## Ethyl Acetate
EtOAc can be procured as "[M.E.K Substitute](https://www.kleanstrip.com/uploads/documents/GME71SUB_SDS-1636.pdf)" for around $26 per gallon. eBay's cheapest listing is for technical grade at $43 per gallon.

Purification is pretty easy. The main impurities are water, ethanol, and acetic acid. Water can be removed by drying with a suitable drying agent (K~2~CO~3~, CaSO~4~ or MgSO~4~). If a neutral or acidic drying agent is used, a separate prewashing step with a base is necessary to neutralize the acetic acid. Ethanol-EtOAc azeotrope boils at 62.3C. Water-EtOAc azeotrope boils at 70.4C. There is also a ternary azeotrope at 70.3C.

~5g of anhydrous potassium carbonate is added to 2L technical grade EtOAC to dry and neutralize for several hours. Then distill. I discard the first 2-4% just to be safe.

Alternatively, EtOAc can be washed with 5% sodium carbonate solution, then dried with calcium or magnesium sulfate. Then distill.

## Acetone

The main impurities in acetone are water and small quantities of other organics. The water cannot be removed with silica gel, calcium chloride, magnesium sulfate, or alumina since these lead to more impurities.

Dry acetone with 25g/L calcium sulfate for several hours. Molecular sieves can also be used. Decant and distill over 10 g/L fresh calcium sulfate.

If you care about the organic impurities, reflux acetone and add small portions of potassium permanganate until violet color persists. Then dry and distill as usual.

Do not let the dessicants remain in the solution for more than a few hours. Molecular sieves, for example, work well for initial drying but actually catalyse condensation reactions in the long run. [@burfield_desiccant_1978]

## Toluene

Toluene is sold as a solvent in most hardware stores, although it is becoming increasingly hard to come by.

The main impurities in toluene are water and sulfurous compounds.

Add 100ml concentrated sulfuric acid per liter of toluene and mix for several hours. Decant and repeat until the acid remains clear (3-4 times). Then wash toluene with 5% sodium bicarbonate solution being careful to avoid bubble over. Wash with water. Then dry over calcium sulfate, calcium chloride, or molecular sieves for 1-3 days. Distill and discard the first 5%.

The same procedure applies to xylene.

## Methanol
Methanol is sold for about $5 per liter as HEET brand gas line antifreeze. The ISOHEET version is isopropanol.

Methanol is just full of impurities. Water, ketones, aldehydes, ammmonia, alcohols, and lots more. I mostly care about the water, so I fractionally distill and discard 3-5%.

If I ever need analytical grade methanol, I will add 5g of degreased magnesium turnings and 0.5g iodine to a 2L flask. Warm the flask until iodine vapor coats the turnings. Add 50ml methanol and heat to reflux for 10-20 minutes. Cool. Add 1L methanol and reflux for a few hours. Then distill.

## Isopropanol

Isopropyl alcohol is everywhere sold as rubbing alcohol in water solutions as high as 99%. With the recent epidemic, sources were scarce, so I purified my stock from ISOHEET.

ISOHEET contains additives so the first step is to distill. Stop distillation when the last 5-10 ml is left. Dry the distillate with calcium sulfate or molecular sieves.

Isopropanol tends to form explosive peroxides in storage, especially while in contact with oxygen. Reflux with stannous chloride to remove.

# Carbon Dioxide Generator

$MgSO_{4}\cdot7H_{2}O + 2NaHCO_{3} \to 2NaSO_{4} + Mg(OH)_{2} + 8H_{2}O + 2CO_{2}$

For every liter of $CO_{2}$ (45mmol; 1.98g) required, mix 5.54g epsom salts (magnesium sulfate heptahydrate) with 1.89g sodium bicarbonate.

# Chloroform Synthesis
Assuming calcium hypochlorite is roughly twice the enthalpy of formation of the sodium variety (twice the number of hypochlorite groups), the total enthalpy change for this synthesis is 670 kJ/mol chloroform.

For every mole of chloroform produced (120g; 81 ml), approximately 2kg (110 mol) of ice will melt. I believe the hth pool chlorine product uses pre-hydrated hypochlorite, so the heat of solution isn't an issue. If anhydrous hypochlorite is used, an additional 940 kJ/mol will be evolved.

## Procedure
For each mole (81ml) of chloroform produced:

- 2kg of ice is added to a suitable glass or plastic container
- 215g of pure calcium hypochlorite is added as 370g of 58% hypochlorite pool chlorinator
- A few hundred mLs of water may be needed to dissolve the hypochlorite
- 1 mol of butanone (90ml), acetone (74ml), 95% ethanol (61ml), or isopropanol (76ml) is added over the course of a few minutes with stirring

## Standard enthalpy of formation

- butanone = -273.3 kJ/mol
- chloroform = -134.3 kJ/mol
- sodium hypochlorite = -347.1 kJ/mol
- calcium hypochlorite < -150 cal/g (-90 kJ/mol)
- propionic acid = -510.8 kJ/mol

## Heat of solution

- calcium hypochlorite = 150 kcal/mol (627 kJ/mol)

## Enthalpy change of fusion

- water = 6.01 kJ/mol

## Heat capacity

- water = 75.4 J/(mol K)
