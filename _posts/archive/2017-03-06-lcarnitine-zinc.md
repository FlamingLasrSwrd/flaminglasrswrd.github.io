# Zinc Purification
Used food grade equipment: mason jars...  
**Zinc**
  - 65.38 g/mol  

**Zinc Carbonate**
  - 125.388 g/mol
  - ZnCO<sub>3</sub>  

**Zinc Sulfate**
  - 161.436 g/mol
  - ZnSO<sub>4</sub>  

**Zinc Acetate**
  - Zn(O2CCH3)2
  - 183.48 g/mol  

**Sodium Carbonate**
  - 105.99 g/mol  

## Procedure
[Make Zinc Metal by Electrolysis - Nurdrage](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3WJFsr7HDY)
1. Added 50g ZnSo4 to 200 ml H2O
2. Stirred until dissolved
3. Added ~0.1g zinc metal
4. Stirred for 30 min
5. Allowed to settle; decanted; filtered
6. Electroplated zinc metal onto aluminum cathode, MMO on titanium anode; constant stirring; 5v;
7. Recovered 7.61g solid zinc metal; rinsed, dried; recovered sulfuric acid;
8. Added 300 ml household vinegar
9.

1. Zinc sulfate made previously by reacting impure zinc with sulfuric acid, filtering, then evaporating to dryness.
2. 50.0 g zinc sulfate
3. 57.7 g/100 ml solubility in H<sub>2</sub>O @ 25 &deg C; 101g/100ml H<sub>2</sub>O at 70 &deg C
4. added 100 ml dH<sub>2</sub>O
5. add extra 25 ml dH<sub>2</sub>O
6. filtered
7. rinsed with dH<sub>2</sub>O
8. add 0.15g powdered zinc metal
9. stir for 5 min
10. filtered
11. let sit 48 hrs
12. 2x filter (small white precipitate formed)
13. recrystallized- evaporated until first crystals formed then cooled in freezer
14. 33g sodium carbonate dissolved in 100ml H<sub>2</sub>O, filtered
15. Added to sulfate soln. until pH 7 - overshot adjusted with dilute HCl
16. evaporated to dryness; yield: 38g ZnCO<sub>3</sub> hydrate
17. neutralized with household vinegar (slowly)
18. filtered; a surprising amount of white precipitate left over - common ion solubility problems?
19. evaporated to dryness; <100 &deg;C to preserve hydrate form
20. **FAILED** - sodium acetate present and discolors product from #19 -> need to find an alterate route without sodium ion
