<p>The idea here is to make sodium using deep eutectic solvents to catalyze the reaction between magnesium and sodium hydroxide (chloride?) or electrolyze a sodium salt. No tertiary alcohol catalysts or exotic solvents required.</p>
<ul>
<li>Choline chloride:zinc chloride seems to be a suitable DES
<ul>
<li>both have to be purchased online</li>
</ul></li>
<li>solubilities are not that great, but that may not be a problem if you are going with the Mg/NaOH route</li>
<li>Mostly based on the research from <span class="citation" data-cites="bagh_ionic_2014">(Bagh 2014)</span></li>
<li>DES‚Äôs have the advantage of reusability and low vapor pressure</li>
<li>Might face the same problems that NurdRage was having in his sodium production due to water contamination</li>
