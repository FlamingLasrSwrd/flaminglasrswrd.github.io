I"˜,<h1 id="intro">Intro</h1>
<p>My parents have a stretch of land of approximately twenty acres which, at the present moment, is generating no income. Our neighbor bails hay from the land a few times a year. We don‚Äôt charge him for this service since it keeps small trees and shrubs from taking over and it‚Äôs the neighborly thing to do.</p>
<p>Since none of us children want to farm the land or wish to rent it out, I decided to look into timber production. The idea is to have a minimally managed tree farm from which my siblings and I can retire. Initial projections indicate that 10-15 acres of properly managed black walnut trees can provide an income of $300k to $1M after 40-60 years. Growth time variation is largely site specific, and the income variation is largely management specific. A similarly sized veneer quality tree can go for 3-15x the price of a sawlog tree.<span class="citation" data-cites="treiman_missouri_2017">(Treiman and Morris 2017)</span> The goal, then, is to maximize the production of veneer quality logs.</p>
<p>This page is dedicated to developing a plan and schedule for establishing a primarily black walnut timber plantation on 12 acres of north eastern Kansas forest/grassland.</p>

<p>So really the only features worth looking for are foliation dates and anthracnose resistance. An extended growing season is preferable with more southern trees having earlier foliation and later defoliation dates. Rink et al. recommends obtaining seeds from 100-200 miles south of plantation. <span class="citation" data-cites="rink_practical_2017">(Rink et al. 2017)</span> The Lawrence (where I live) is about 75 miles south of my home making it a fairly good place to source walnuts. Perhaps just south of town would be more appropriate.</p>
<p>Highly profitable figure wood does not appear to be heritable, either. <span class="citation" data-cites="mckenna_propagating_2015">(McKenna et al. 2015)</span></p>

<p>Jacobs et al. recommends mechanical site preparation followed by herbicide application before and after planting black walnut seedlings using a mechanical planter. The first year after planting is the most critical for survival. Cover crops do not significantly alter survival of seedlings, but that may have been a statistical anomaly. Current deer browse control methods are lacking. Only about half of trees were free to grow at 5 years. <span class="citation" data-cites="jacobs_establishment_2004">(Jacobs, Ross-Davis, and Davis 2004)</span></p>

<p>Hops can be planted on the perimeter of a newly established plantation and ginseng seems to be tolerant of any stage of black walnut growth. <span class="citation" data-cites="ha_costs_2017">(Ha et al. 2017)</span></p>
<h1 id="current-plan">Current Plan</h1>
<ul>
<li>obtain an excess of black walnuts from the south Lawrence area</li>
<li>scarify seeds underground at the farm over winter</li>

<li>optional broad spectrum herbicide</li>
<li>burn field in late fall</li>
<li>disc field</li>
<li>plant cover crop of clover in fall or spring</li>
<li>plant windbreak of locusts transplanted from south pasture</li>
</ul>

<li>a friend recommended pecan trees in addition to walnuts: I am not that interested in nut production, so pecans aren‚Äôt likely to make an appearance</li>
<li>I am a little disappointed that I will be unable to grow wasabi plants‚Äì they require much colder temperatures</li>

<h2 id="may-2020">15 May 2020</h2>
<p>This project has fallen by the wayside.</p>
<p>I‚Äôm searching for a way to propagate black walnut trees. The softwood cutting didn‚Äôt work at all. The original paper authors also failed to get mature tree cuttings to root.</p>
<p>The University of California appears to have had success with <a href="http://walnutrootstock.ucanr.edu/WIP/Propagation/layering/Air_Layering/">air layering</a> saplings. I would like to give this a try.</p>
<p>Also,</p>
<h2 id="aug-2019">21 Aug 2019</h2>
<p>First clone testing using the new ultrasonic cloner. Softwood cutting taken from my neighbor‚Äôs small walnut tree (3-4 years old). Leaves trimmed to all but the last two. This would be classified as a mature plant and thus unlikely to develop roots.</p>
<h2 id="mar-2019">18 Mar 2019</h2>
<p>Clones may be better for timber plantations: they tend to grow faster at the expense of nut production. <span class="citation" data-cites="rink_practical_2017">(Rink et al. 2017)</span></p>
<h2 id="mar-2019-1">17 Mar 2019</h2>
<p>Twelve acres of land with walnuts planted in 8‚Äôx8‚Äô spacing equals around 8200 plants.</p>
<h2 id="mar-2019-2">16 Mar 2019</h2>
<p>Looking into taking cuttings from my local dog park. Softwood cuttings rooted in a mist bench with K-IBA using 3:1 perlite:vermiculite resulted in 72% success. <span class="citation" data-cites="stevens_origin_2017">(Stevens and Pijut 2017)</span></p>
