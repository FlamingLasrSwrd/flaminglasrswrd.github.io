</ul>
<h2 id="feb-2019">16 Feb 2019</h2>
<p>A wall mounted box with continuously circulated chilled nutrient solution. - submerged pump to circulate water - drip irrigation - peltier cooler to keep water temperature around 50F - gravel media bed - plastic liner - styrofoam insulator - wood casing - plants can get quite large: 1-2 ft tall/wide - planter box must be at least 1 ft deep (might be heavy) - 12-18 months maturation time - aquaponics‚Ä¶ too complicated and limited options</p>
<ul>
<li>ideal water temperature is 54-59F</li>
<li>pH 6.0-7.0</li>
<li>E.C. between 0.03 and 0.2 milliohm per cm</li>
<li>less than 0.1 ppm ammonia nitrogen and no nitrite-nitrogen</li>
<li>2 in sand -&gt; 3 in gravel -&gt; 16-40 in small rocks (3 in diameter)</li>
<li>each plant requires at least 1/2 sq. ft.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<p>Phosphorus levels in this water range from 0.06 to 2.2 ppm, and potassium levels average between 2.0 and 3.0 ppm. 12-12-12 (N-P-K) is applied to the water at the rate of 0.02 pounds per square foot A foliar application of sulfur is sometimes made 1‚Äì3 months before harvest to enhance the flavor of wasabi. planting wasabi so that the crown of the plant is approximately ¬Ω inch above the soil surface <span class="citation" data-cites="miles_growing_2008">(Miles and Chadwick 2008)</span></p>
