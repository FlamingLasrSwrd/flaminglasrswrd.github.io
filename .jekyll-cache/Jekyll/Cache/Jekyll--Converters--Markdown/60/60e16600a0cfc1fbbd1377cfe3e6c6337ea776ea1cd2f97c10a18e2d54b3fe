<h2 id="metabolism">Metabolism</h2>
<p>Ninety percent of ethanol is metabolized in the liver after multiple passages but the lungs (especially via CYP2E1) also contribute to metabolism. <span class="citation" data-cites="JDinis-OliveiraOxidativenonoxidativemetabolomics2016">J Dinis-Oliveira (2016)</span> In the gastric mucosa (and not in the small intestine), 5-10% of ethanol is metabolized by alcohol dehydrogenase isoform (or isozyme) 7 (ADH7) and this is called gastric first pass metabolism of ethanol [3, 4]. <span class="citation" data-cites="JDinis-OliveiraOxidativenonoxidativemetabolomics2016">J Dinis-Oliveira (2016)</span> The Km of CYP2E1 for ethanol is 10 mM, which is roughly one order of magnitude higher than that of ADH1. <span class="citation" data-cites="JDinis-OliveiraOxidativenonoxidativemetabolomics2016">J Dinis-Oliveira (2016)</span> Therefore, CYP2E1 and catalase are the main pathways in the brain that metabolize ethanol to acetaldehyde, while ADH appears to play a minor role. <span class="citation" data-cites="HernandezLipidsOxidativeStress2016">Hernández, López-Sánchez, and Rendón-Ramírez (2016)</span> The oxidation of ethanol to acetaldehyde can occur in the brain through pathways that involve catalase, cytochrome CYP2E1, and ADH. <span class="citation" data-cites="HernandezLipidsOxidativeStress2016">Hernández, López-Sánchez, and Rendón-Ramírez (2016)</span> First pass metabolism of alcohol occurs in the stomach and is decreased in alcoholics. <span class="citation" data-cites="cederbaum_alcohol_2012">Cederbaum (2012)</span> Alcohol metabolism is regulated by the nutritional state, the concentration of alcohol,specific isoforms of alcohol dehyrogenase, need to remove acetaldehyde and regenerate NAD and induction of CYP2E1. <span class="citation" data-cites="cederbaum_alcohol_2012">Cederbaum (2012)</span> Whereas metabolism of the major nutrients is under hormonal control, e.g insulin/glucagon, leptin, catecholamine, thyroid hormones, generally, there is little hormonal regulation to pace the rate of alcohol elimination. <span class="citation" data-cites="cederbaum_alcohol_2012">Cederbaum (2012)</span> Animals with small body weight metabolize alcohol at faster rates than larger animals e.g. the rate of alcohol elimination in mice is 5 times greater than the rate in humans. <span class="citation" data-cites="cederbaum_alcohol_2012">Cederbaum (2012)</span> However, it is important to note that alcohol-derived calories are produced at the expense of the metabolism of normal nutrients since alcohol will be oxidized preferentially over other nutrients (19–23). <span class="citation" data-cites="cederbaum_alcohol_2012">Cederbaum (2012)</span> The Km of CYP2E1 for alcohol is 10 mM ,10-fold higher than the Km of ADH for ethanol but still within the range of alcohol concentrations seen in social drinking.

<h3 id="adh">ADH</h3>
<p>Nonetheless, ADH4 inhibition avoids the synaptic dysfunction associated with severe alcohol intoxication in the hippocampus [89]. @HernandezLipidsOxidativeStress2016 Liver alcohol dehydrogenase is the major enzyme system for metabolizing alcohol; this requires the cofactor NAD and the products produced are acetaldehyde and NADH. <span class="citation" data-cites="cederbaum_alcohol_2012">Cederbaum (2012)</span> There is, however, no correlation between the alcohol dehydrogenase activity measured in vitro and the rate of ethanol oxidation in vivo or in liver slices [2,3,4]. As the activity of the enzyme does not appear to be the rate-limiting factor, it is assumed that the oxidation of NADH is rate- limiting for the ethanol oxidation in vivo. <span class="citation" data-cites="thieden_effect_1972">Thieden et al. (1972)</span> Moreover, a small amount of ethanol can be oxidized to acetaldehyde by alcohol dehydrogenase (ADH) classes I and IV [52, 55] in the stomach and intestine. This acetaldehyde can be absorbed along with ethanol and metabolized by the liver or other tissues. <span class="citation" data-cites="HernandezLipidsOxidativeStress2016">Hernández, López-Sánchez, and Rendón-Ramírez (2016)</span> Most first pass metabolism occurs in the liver [49, 55] and the rate-limiting step is the oxidation of ethanol to acetaldehyde. This reaction is catalyzed by proteins of the ADH family [56], of which class I (ADH1) and III (ADH3) enzymes metabolize ethanol in the liver [57, 58]. <span class="citation" data-cites="HernandezLipidsOxidativeStress2016">Hernández, López-Sánchez, and Rendón-Ramírez (2016)</span> Indeed, ethanol is primarily bioactivated (92-95%) by cytosolic (especially hepatic) ADH1B into acetaldehyde, which has proved to have mutagen and carcinogen effects [1]. <span class="citation" data-cites="JDinis-OliveiraOxidativenonoxidativemetabolomics2016">J Dinis-Oliveira (2016)</span> The gastric mucosa expresses three classes of ADH isozymes in a decreasing order of affinity for ethanol: gamma-ADH, a class I isozyme also present in the liver, sigma-ADH, a class IV ADH characteristic of the upper digestive tract, and chi-ADH, a class III isozyme found in most tissues. we found a 58% reduction in class III (or chi -) ADH activity in women compared with men (Fig. 3), <span class="citation" data-cites="BaraonaGenderDifferencesPharmacokinetics2001">Baraona et al. (2001)</span></p>
<h3 id="aldh">ALDH</h3>
<p>The acetaldehyde is further oxidized to acetate, the same final metabolite produced from all other nutrients-carbohydrates, fats and proteins; the acetate can be converted to CO2, fatty acids, ketone bodies, cholesterol and steroids. <span class="citation" data-cites="cederbaum_alcohol_2012">Cederbaum (2012)</span> The low Km mitochondrial ALDH oxidizes most of the acetaldehyde produced from the oxidation of alcohol, although in human liver, the class I cytosolic ALDH may also contribute (75). <span class="citation" data-cites="cederbaum_alcohol_2012">Cederbaum (2012)</span> In general, the capacity of ALDH to remove acetaldehyde exceeds the capacity of acetaldehyde generation by the various pathways of alcohol oxidation. Therefore, circulating levels of acetaldehyde are usually very low. <span class="citation" data-cites="cederbaum_alcohol_2012">Cederbaum (2012)</span> The acetaldehyde produced by the oxidation of ethanol is thereafter transformed to acetate by aldehyde dehydrogenase (ALDH) [61], which can be further metabolized through the tricarboxylic acid cycle to generate energy, or these metabolites can be deposited in the plasma [62, 63]. <span class="citation" data-cites="HernandezLipidsOxidativeStress2016">Hernández, López-Sánchez, and Rendón-Ramírez (2016)</span></p>
<h3 id="cyp2e1">CYP2E1</h3>
<p>Oxidation of alcohol by cytochrome P450 pathways, especially CYP2E1 which is induced by alcohol, are secondary pathways to remove alcohol especially at high concentrations. <span class="citation" data-cites="cederbaum_alcohol_2012">Cederbaum (2012)</span> Among the cytochrome P450 family, CYP2E1 has been identified as the most relevant for ALD as it is highly inducible and it has high catalytic activity for alcohol [18]. @leung_cyp2e1_2013 CYP2E1 is mainly expressed in the liver, with hepatocytes showing the highest expression, but it is also located in other organs such as the brain and intestine. CYP2E1 is mainly located within the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) although it is also expressed in the mitochondria [23]. @leung_cyp2e1_2013 This indicates that CYP4A induction could be an alternative pathway when CYP2E1 is less available [28]. @leung_cyp2e1_2013 <a href="#cyp2e1">CYP2E1</a> enzyme is induced in response to chronic drinking and it may contribute to the increased rates of ethanol elimination in heavy drinkers. Some endogenous substrates for CYP2E1 include acetone and fatty acids, both of which are abundant in the brain [95]. @HernandezLipidsOxidativeStress2016 At high blood ethanol levels, the microsomal ethanol-oxidizing system (CYP2E1 isoform, located in the smooth endoplasmic reticulum) also has an important role. Ethanol itself induces the activity of CYP2E1, and therefore also influences the metabolism of other xenobiotics ( e.g. paracetemol and cocaine) <span class="citation" data-cites="JDinis-OliveiraOxidativenonoxidativemetabolomics2016">J Dinis-Oliveira (2016)</span></p>
<h3 id="catalase">Catalase</h3>
<p>Studies using inhibitors of catalase and acatalasemic mice revealed that catalase is responsible for approximately half of the ethanol metabolism occurring in the CNS [91]. @HernandezLipidsOxidativeStress2016 <a href="#catalase">Catalase</a> pathway is limited by the rather low rates of H2O2 generation produced under physiological cellular conditions (less than 4 umol/g liver/hr, only 2% that of alcohol oxidation) and appears to have an insignificant role in alcohol oxidation by the liver. <span class="citation" data-cites="cederbaum_alcohol_2012">Cederbaum (2012)</span> Indeed, acetaldehyde production in the brain in vivo depends on catalase activity [85, 93] and catalase appears to be expressed in all neural cells. <span class="citation" data-cites="HernandezLipidsOxidativeStress2016">Hernández, López-Sánchez, and Rendón-Ramírez (2016)</span> Catalase is of minor importance (responsible for approximately 5%) in the metabolism of ethanol. <span class="citation" data-cites="JDinis-OliveiraOxidativenonoxidativemetabolomics2016">J Dinis-Oliveira (2016)</span></p>
<h2 id="elimination">Elimination</h2>
<p>Alcohol elimination now follows Michaelis-Menten kinetics; the rate of change in the concentration of alcohol depends on the concentration of alcohol and the kinetic constants Km and Vmax (23,24). <span class="citation" data-cites="cederbaum_alcohol_2012">Cederbaum (2012)</span> Unchanged ethanol is eliminated in small quantities (approximately 5% of orally absorbed ethanol) by the kidneys (0.5–2%), lungs (1.6–6%) and skin (&lt;0.5%) [4]. <span class="citation" data-cites="JDinis-OliveiraOxidativenonoxidativemetabolomics2016">J Dinis-Oliveira (2016)</span> We confirmed the observation by others (Dubowski 1976; Mishra et al., 1989) that the rate of ethanol oxidation, a function predominantly exerted by the liver, is faster in women than in men.

<p>although metabolites of ethanol, like acetate, can also reach the brain as products of first pass metabolism [85]. @HernandezLipidsOxidativeStress2016 A significant body of evidence indicates that acetaldehyde is accumulated in the colonic lumen due to enteric microbial fermentation (22, 23). <span class="citation" data-cites="basuroy_acetaldehyde_2005">Basuroy et al.

<p>Treatment of macrophages with physiologically relevant doses (25 mM, 50 mM, 75 mM) of alcohol for 15 min significantly increased HSF-binding activity (Fig. 1B). A combination of LPS with alcohol (50 mM and 75 mM) resulted in a further augmentation of HSF DNA binding as indicated in the bar graph (Fig. 1B, lower panel), as compared with LPS or alcohol treatment alone (Fig. 1B). <span class="citation" data-cites="mandrekar_alcohol_2008">Mandrekar et al.

Hsp70 induction is regulated by cooperation from other transcription factors such as STAT1, which interacts directly with HSF-1 to induce hsp70 [45]. @mandrekar_alcohol_2008 Here, it is likely that acute alcohol directly increases transcription of hsp70, which in turn could repress TNF-<span class="math inline">\(\alpha\)</span> gene expression.
