<p>Just received a new shipment of green coffee from Sweet Maria’s. I decided to try another test.</p>
<h2 id="aug-2019">09 Aug 2019</h2>
<p>My friend Erin and I tested a couple of the fermented beans with interesting results. The 48hr CO2 batch resulted in a spicy brew. I mean really spicy. The 24hr diH2O did not however. This warrants further investigation.</p>
<p>Apparently there is a startup, <a href="https://www.afineur.com/">afineur</a>, which specializes in fermented coffee beans. They sell them for $50/lb. Their goal seems to be reducing acidity and bitterness, not emphasizing flavors. I bet there is a market here…</p>

<p>Finally dried the “48-hour” beans. They have been in the fridge since the actual 48-hour mark.</p>

<p>The beans in the dehydrator are “done”. They were removed and placed in labeled, plastic bags. Without proper water content testing I can’t really be sure. I don’t think it matters, however, since the beans are destined to be completely dehydrated and burned during roasting.</p>

<p>The 48-hour fermentation beans are starting to smell off. This may be too long for room temperature fermentation. Neither jar smells better than the other, so I do not think the acidic environment helped.</p>

<p>I poured about half of each jar into a sieve to drain, then put them in my dehydrator. The temperature is about 40C. I picked out all the seeds which had “sprouted”. Oddly enough, the carbonic acid jar batch (left) had roughly twice the number of sprouts. Weird.</p>

<p>Anyway, ten of each of the best looking seeds were placed in a 50:50 verm:coir potting mix. After completing one of the pots I realized that the sprout could actually be a stem, not a root. So one entire pot is planted with the sprout facing down and the other pot is a 50:50 mix of up/down. Both pots were put on my plant shelf alongside the other pot of coffee seeds planted about a week ago.</p>

<p>Added 200g of green coffee to a 1qt mason jar and filled half-again with club soda (carbonic acid)<a href="#fn1" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref1"><sup>1</sup></a> at about 8pm. Added a second trial of the same except used deionized water. I will “ferment” these beans for at least 24 hours before drying them. Perhaps I will split the trials into 24 and 48 hour samples. I could also try some longer fermentation times in the refrigerator.</p>

<p>The beans in the dehydrator have lost approximately 41g (down to 259g total). I roasted these and still had substantially the same problem of varied colors. I also noticed that even the “green” roasted beans were thoroughly roasted and could break easily. Perhaps the original beans were fermented differently? I could try to ferment them again, although it wouldn’t be as effective without the mucilaginous layer of the whole coffee cherry.</p>
<p>I should take some samples and determine the actually water content the right way.</p>

<p>A few weeks ago on my Guatemala trip, I acquired 10lbs of green coffee beans (for $16 hehe) at a street market in Santa Cruz del Quiche. Upon first roasting, the coffee had wide variations in color. Many beans were still green looking while others were full dark roast. I do not like dark roast so this batch was not very pleasant. My first thought was that they were unevenly dried. So I set 200g in my dehydrator at around 35C.</p>

<p>Previously I attempted to use sonication to make coffee. The results were promising, but I never followed up.</p>
