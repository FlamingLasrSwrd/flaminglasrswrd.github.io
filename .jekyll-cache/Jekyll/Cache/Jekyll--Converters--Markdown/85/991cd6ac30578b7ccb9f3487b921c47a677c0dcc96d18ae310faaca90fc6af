<p>Built a quick foam cutter out of old toaster nichrome and some bits of wood. The power was adjusted manually using an alligator clip.</p>
<p>Polypropylene foam was stretched over the foam forms and attached using hot glue and sewing pins.</p>
<p>Magnetic strip tape was used to line the edges so the whole thing could be disassembled and stored away. I certainly don’t have and extra 4 cubic feet to just have this thing sitting on my desk all the time…</p>
