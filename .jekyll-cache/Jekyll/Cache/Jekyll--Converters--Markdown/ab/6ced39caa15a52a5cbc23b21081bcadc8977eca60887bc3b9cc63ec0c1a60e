<p>Many medicinal plants have a tendency to bioaccumulate heavy metals. This is a big problem for traditionally grown plants especially when the fertilizer is organic in nature. <span class="citation" data-cites="nookabkaew_concentrations_2016">(Nookabkaew et al. 2016)</span> Similarly, anthroponegic sources of cadmium are often the culprit of contamination (e.g. biosolids or industrial runoff).</p>
<p>Synthetic fertilizers are not immune to this contamination, however. Cadmium naturally occurs in phosphate rock. Synthetic phosphorus fertilizers are directly produced from this rock and therefore have higher than background concentrations of cadmium.</p>

<p>Kanna is an African succulent that does not do well with overwatering. It thrives in high light and high heat.</p>
<p>Kanna may drop all of its leaves during the summer and regrow them in the winter.</p>
<p>Kanna may be suitable for a fertigation based hydroponic cultivation.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>It was observed that more optimal vegetative growth was not necessarily desirable in terms of alkaloid concentration, which suggests that reasonable amounts of stress could increase alkaloid concentrations in the plant. Chapter 3 found soilless media with higher water holding capacity (media containing coco-peat and vermiculite) yielded more desirable results in terms of vegetative growth than media that did not (media containing pure silica sand and/or perlite). Too frequent (every week) or infrequent (every fifth week) fertigation is not ideal for vegetative growth, instead plants reacted significantly to fertigation at 3 week intervals. One can therefore suggest that well drained, yet high water holding capacity soilless media in conjunction with mid-frequent fertigation intervals would yield the best results in terms of vegetative growth.</p>

<p>Preparation method seems to be important. Perhaps to reduce oxalate content or even to enhance psychoactivity.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>When the subjects further attempted to ingest unfermented plant material which had been freeze-dried, by mouth, the acidity was most objectionable and the exercise was discontinued. …perhaps the physical crushing of the plant and the fermentation process may, in some way, ameliorate the potentially harmful effects of oxalic acid.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The fermentation method involves placing the whole plant in a sealed plastic bag in the sun for several days, opened and mixed, then sealed for a total of eight days. The plant material is then dried in the sun in a thin layer.</p>
<p>Kanna is also traditionally prepared by burying the whole plant in hot sand left under a fire pit for one hour or overnight. <span class="citation" data-cites="smith_psychoactive_1996">(Smith et al. 1996)</span></p>

<p>I received 21 ICS95 cacao cuttings from Puerto Rico. They were immediately dipped in IBA rooting hormone, planted in a 50:50 vermiculite:coconut coir potting media, and watered with half strength (masterblend) nutrient solution.</p>
<p>Several days later I pulled 9 cuttings from the pot and placed them in my ultrasonic mist bench. The others were repotted in the same verm:coir mix in a smaller container. I attempted to use a plastic bag as a humidity dome, but it became too unwieldy. The mist bench has an inverted clear plastic tote which fits perfectly.</p>
<p>Thus far I have seen little to indicate they are growing roots. Apparently mist benches have the tendency to osmotically pull nutrients from the cuttings when used with pure water (which I did).</p>

<p>The M. speciosa plants are doing well after their transplant to hydroponics. I tested the bumblebee cultivar first since I have a spare. Just a simple DWC using half-strength general purpose “Masterblend” nutrients. After 24 hours with no wilting or other deleterious effects, I did the other three plants in a similar manner.</p>
<p>The roots are rinsed to remove as much soil matter as possible.</p>
<p>Initial test with bumblebee.</p>
<p>Completed set up with all four plants.</p>
<p>Some of the root balls wouldn’t quite fit into 6&quot; net pots.</p>
<p>I decided to test a sponge filter in one of the buckets. The rest have 0.5 micron stainless steel spargers. MSI001 has the sponge filter.</p>
<p>The volume of air going through the sponge filter is less than ideal. The unit is designed for high flow and low pressure. I would like to design one for 3D printing that has better aeration with finer bubbles.</p>
<p>I think it is time to start generating shoots.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Nodal explants harvested during spring season from the lopped tree differentiated the maximum number of axillary shoots (5.3 ± 0.82 per node) on full-strength Murashige and Skoog (MS) medium containing 3.0 mg L−1 6-benzylaminopurine (BAP) and additives (25 mg L−1 each of adenine sulfate, L-arginine, and citric acid and 50 mg L−1 ascorbic acid).</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The greatest number of shoots (13.4 ± 1.26) with an average length of 6.2 ± 1.03 cm was produced after 4 wk on MS medium containing 0.5 mg L−1 BAP, 0.25 mg L−1 kinetin (Kin), 0.1 mg L−1 Indole-3-acetic acid (IAA), additives, 100 mg L−1 activated charcoal (AC), and 0.8% (w/v) agar.<span class="citation" data-cites="patel_improved_2020">(Patel, Lodha, and Shekhawat 2020)</span></p>
</blockquote>
<p>So I need stock solutions of citric acid, ascorbic acid, kinetin, IAA, and BAP. I also need to grind some activated carbon. I don’t have any arginine or adenine sulfate right now. Neither seems to be especially necessary, so I will try without. Arginine is easy enough to get, but adenine is insanely expensive. I will also need 1N NaOH.</p>
<p>That particular paper doesn’t use filtering for the PGRs. Everything is added prior to autoclaving.</p>

<p>Mother explants can be detached from their shoots and repeatedly multiplied. Alternatively, daughter shoots can be repeatedly subcultured. <span class="citation" data-cites="patel_improved_2020">(Patel, Lodha, and Shekhawat 2020)</span></p>
<p>The original paper calls for mercuric chloride sterilization. Ya… not doing that.</p>
<p>Exudates are a problem:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The problem of phenolic exudation/leaching was observed during culture initiation. To conquer this, sterilized nodal explants were treated with the sterile pre-chilled antioxidant solution (ascorbic acid and citric acid 0.1% (w/v)) for 18 to 20 min prior to inoculation.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Additionally, such initial exposure of explants to dark/diffused light conditions for a certain period can promote morphogenesis by axillary meristem activation as reported by Panwar et al. (2018).</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Take explants in the spring:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Explants collected during the spring season were better in terms of percentage bud-breaking response, early bud-breaking, or days to respond and showed the least contamination in this study.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Cytokinins are necessary.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Explants cultured on MS basal medium (control) did not show any bud-breaking.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Arginine for shoot elongation</p>
<blockquote>
<p>According to Greenwell and Ruter (2018), the molecular structure of arginine (C6H14N4O2) includes two extra nitrogen (imino) groups, and this higher percentage of reduced nitrogen (32.2%) may have been responsible for the improved shoot elongation (3.69 ± 0.59 cm).</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Adenine sulfate can improve shoot induction and health. It’s addition was not tested and, considering the price, I am not sure if it is worth it.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>In additives, adenine sulfate may have complemented the effect of cytokinins owing to its base structural similarity to cytokinins (Chhajer and Kalia 2017).</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Subculturing seems to work indefinitely.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The shoot cultures were maintained for 2-y by regular subculturing every fourth/fifth week without any change in growth and vigor.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Rooting with 500mg/L IBA</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The basal end of the shoots treated with 500 mg L−1 IBA for 5 min proved the best in which 90.1% of shoots formed the highest number of roots (8.5 ± 0.97 per shoot) with an average length of 9.40 ± 1.06 cm, after 5 wk (Fig. 2e).</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The best results from NAA alone achieved only 66% rooting. The two were not tested together.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Afterwards, successfully hardened plants with more than 80% transplant survival rate were transferred to the nursery and subsequently to the field.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>The micropropagated plants exhibited normal morphology and growth characteristics that are phenotypically analogous to the mother plant.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The explants were washed thoroughly with running tap water for 30 min. The explants were then sterilized with 70% alcohol for 15 seconds and were washed three times. The explants were soaked for 30 min in 40% clorox bleach that contained three drops of Tween-20 and were then washed three times with distilled water. Next, the explants were dried on petri plates that contained a layer of filter paper. After trimming the cut size, the surface-sterilized explants were planted on the culture medium.</p>

<p>The research [20] provides clear evidence that, for the embryo-to-plantlet development under photoautotrophic conditions, the use of Magenta vessels and modified RITA-bioreactor is less effective at promoting shoot and root growth both in and ex vitro compared with the TRI-bioreactor. <span class="citation" data-cites="gupta_plant_2006">(Gupta and Ibaraki 2006)</span></p>
</blockquote>
<p>RITA and Magenta boxes work for plants that tolerate complete and total immersion in the growing media. For rooting, you only want a portion of the plant submerged. That’s where the TRI-bioreactor (Temporary Root Immersion) excels.</p>
<p>The plantlets are put into individual receptacles with an inert support medium (vermiculite and paper waste in this instance). This medium can be directly transferred to final potting soil without disturbing the roots. Autotrophic media results in better survival.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The advantages of growing plants in an environment with reduced relative humidity are manifold such as development of functional stomata, increased wax deposition all of which can, in turn, prevent water loss when transferred ex vitro and thus increase the chance of survival and subsequent growth. Furthermore, in TRI-bioreactor the environmental parameters are maintained in such a way that the difference between the in and ex vitro conditions is minimum, as a consequence when the plants are transferred ex vitro they are capable to photosynthesize normally and thus can easily overcome the transition stress during the first week of ex vitro condition.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The original paper used somatic embryos of Coffea arabusta.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Nodal cuttings of coffee plantlets (Coffea arabusta) were cultured in Magenta vessels containing hormone‐free MS (Murashige and Skoog, 1962) medium supplemented with 20 g l–1 sucrose. After 4 weeks of culture, regenerated leaves were collected and cut into pieces (10 × 5 mm) and were placed in a Magenta vessel containing modified MS medium (for details, see Afreen et al., 2002). Agar (8 g l–1; Kanto Chemical Co., Tokyo, Japan) was used as a gelling agent and 30 g l–1 sucrose was added in the medium.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Cultures were placed in a growth chamber with an air temperature of 23 °C and a 16 h d–1 photoperiod provided by cool‐white fluorescent lamps (National Co., Tokyo, Japan). The ambient CO2 concentration was 400 µmol mol–1 and the photosynthetic photon flux (PPF) was 30 µmol m–2 s–1 measured on the empty culture shelf. Somatic embryos developed within 9–12 weeks of culture.

<p>3 segment displays are only $2.26. Mini swirling agitators with weight activated timers would be cool. After injecting sterilant, the containers can be placed in one of the agitator receptacles. The time automatically starts.</p>
<p>I think a larger touchscreen panel would be better than individual displays. The <a href="https://www.ebay.com/itm/264732551257">cheapest 3.5&quot; resistive touch screens</a> are $16 each and HDMI versions around $25.</p>
<p>I can’t find ferric tartrate dihydrate despite it being a supposed ingredient in Hoagland’s No. 2 and Vacin/West media. It doesn’t exist on either the sigma website (which sells Hoagland No. 2 and <a href="https://www.sigmaaldrich.com/technical-documents/protocols/biology/classic-plant-media.html">lists ferric tartrate dihydrate as and ingredient</a>) or on PubChem.</p>
<p>The original Hoagland and Arnon paper (the revised edition from 1950 anyway) calls it “iron tartrate” and never alludes to the chemical structure.<span class="citation" data-cites="hoagland_water-culture_1950">(Hoagland and Arnon 1950)</span> Vacin and West do indeed spell out the formula as the dihydrate.<span class="citation" data-cites="vacin_ph_1949">(Vacin and Went 1949)</span></p>
<p>This also leads me to question some of the other odd ingredients in Sigma’s collection. Most of them list “MgSO4” but anhydrous magnesium sulphate is uncommon. The heptahydrate is vastly more common.</p>
<p>Indeed, the original formula is for the heptahydrate version, but Sigma translated it to the anhydrous.<span class="citation" data-cites="knudson_nonsymbiotic_1922">(Knudson 1922)</span></p>

<p>Automated sterilizing is worth discussing. A small, autoclavable container that floods and drains a sample in an automated manner.</p>
<p>The choice between parallel or sequential filling/decanting of solutions during sterilization of explants:</p>
<p>The filling and decanting of solutions takes only a short amount of time compared to the soaking time in the case of bleach. For ethanol sterilization, the soak time (~30 seconds) is short enough that the operator can wait. Therefore, automated sterilization should be sequential.</p>
<p>Seeds or explants are placed in appropriately sized autoclavable containers (e.g. Falcon tubes). The appropriate sterilant protocol is selected from the menu and the tube is pushed into the dispensing/evacuating head.</p>
<p>An IR beam-break sensor on the fill head can detect when a tube is loaded for button-free operation.</p>
<p>It would cost me about $0.90 in electricity just to boil 1 gallon of water. It costs $1 to buy distilled water.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Auxin stocks are usually prepared by weighing out 10 mg of auxin into a 200-ml beaker, adding several drops of 1 N NaOH or KOH until the crystals are dissolved (not more than 0.3 ml), rapidly adding 90 ml of double-distilled water, and increasing the volume to 100 ml in a volumetric flask (Huang &amp; Murashige, 1976).</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Auxins can also be dissolved in 95% ethanol and diluted to volume; however, ethanol is toxic to plant tissues. The K-salts of auxin are more soluble in water (Posthumus, 1971).</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Make IAA stocks fresh weekly; IAA is degraded within a few days by light (Yamakawa et al., 1979; Dunlap &amp; Robacker, 1988) and within several hours to a few days by plant tissues (Epstein &amp; Lavee, 1975). Auxins are thermostable at 110–120°C for up to 1 h (Posthumus, 1971; Yamakawa et al., 1979).</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Cytokinin stocks are prepared in a fashion similar to that for auxin stocks, except that 1 N HCl and a few drops of water are used to dissolve the crystals (Huang &amp; Murashige, 1976). Gentle heating is usually required to completely dissolve crystals.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Cytokinin stocks can be stored for several months in the refrigerator.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Cytokinins (kinetin and zeatin) are thermostable; no breakdown products were detected after 1 h at 120°C (Dekhuijzen, 1971); 2iP and BA are stable for 20 min at 100°C.</p>

<p>1“, 2”, 4&quot; sections of grocery store plastic wrap (polyethylene) were cut. Initially I cracked the lids 1/2 turn on the falcon tubes I used for the single seed germination. I though that this was unnecessarily risky, so I sealed them on day 2. Today I unscrewed the tops again 1/2 turn but then wrapped them in 2 layers of plastic wrap.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>A discussion in the Plant-tc listserver mentions the use of Glad-Wrap, which is a polyethylene film with good gas permeability for oxygen, carbon dioxide, and ethylene and with a low permeability for water vapor as compared to Saran-Wrap, a poly-vynilidene copolymer, which has low gas permeability.<span class="citation" data-cites="smith_plant_2013">(Smith 2013)</span></p>
</blockquote>
<p>If this procedure is to continue, perhaps a sock knitting machine could be adapted? Probably over-kill. Besides, for the long-term, filter vents are preferred.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Any type of wrap can create problems in data replication due to variances in the number of layers of wrap and tightness of the wrap. These parameters will make the gas exchange ratios variable.<span class="citation" data-cites="smith_plant_2013">(Smith 2013)</span></p>

<p>I solved my seed rinsing problem: A suction wand.</p>
<p>A small heat resistant tube with a sintered filter on one side and a controlled vacuum line on the other. After soaking in sterilant, a seed can be suctioned to the filter and transferred to the next solution or rinsed directly on the filter. The end can be sterilized in a bead sterilizer just like forceps.</p>
<p>If a liquid trap in placed inline, waste solutions can also be suctioned.</p>

<h3 id="tuber-melanosporum">Tuber melanosporum</h3>
<p>Black truffle innoculated seedling of oak or hazelnut would be a worthy addition to my line of products. They are commercially available for ~$30 each.</p>
<p>Traditional inoculation is accomplished via irrigation with spore suspension from ground truffles. This is hit-or-miss and requires a second, visual verification of inoculation. Even then, the genetics are unknown and truffles have a complex life cycle.<span class="citation" data-cites="zambonelli_genomics_2012 rubini_impact_2014 le_tacon_certainties_2016">(Rubini et al. 2012, 2014; Le Tacon et al. 2016)</span></p>
<p>It has long been assumed that truffles “self” reproduce, that is, a single-individual inoculated tree is capable of producing mature truffles. Research in the last decade has shown that T. melanosporum is, in fact, heterothallic and requires a sexual dimorphic partner to produce mature truffles. This likely also contributes to the paucity of research in in-vitro cultivation. Isolates of T. melanosporum would likely never produce truffles.</p>
<p>In short, there are “male” and “female” T. melanosporum and you don’t get the baby truffles unless you have one of each.</p>
<p>I wonder if morels are the same way… <em>edit: yes</em> <span class="citation" data-cites="chai_characterization_2017 liu_opposite_2018">(Chai et al. 2017; Liu et al. 2018)</span></p>
<p>Even if you manage to inoculate two compatible partners on the same tree, given sufficient time, one will dominate. <span class="citation" data-cites="rubini_impact_2014">(Rubini et al. 2014)</span></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Host plants can sustain genetically different T. melanosporum strains on their roots, provided that all of the strains share the same mating type.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Alternatively, one could inoculate one tree with a single individual and plant it next to a different tree with a sexually compatible T. melanosporum. An entire plantation of checkerboard mating types could be established.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>In theory, plants harboring MAT1-2-1 or MAT1-1-1 strains should be numerically and spatially equally distributed at a site to facilitate reciprocal mating of the fungal partners.<br />
Unfortunately, it is not possible to predict which of the two mating types outcompetes the other on plants inoculated with spores, and screening individual plants to identify the mating types of their symbiotic strain(s) is not feasible due to the cost.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>As an alternative to spores, mycelia grown in vitro can be used as inocula. These mycelia can be isolated from mycorrhizas adapted to specific microhabitats and/or from fruiting bodies with a superior quality/size to encourage the propagation of strains that retain useful traits.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>However, caution is needed when using plants inoculated by this approach in large-scale cultivation programs because there is a risk of propagating only a few fungal genotypes due to the difficulty of isolating and growing truffle strains in vitro.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>It seems that hit-or-miss spore inoculation is still the de-facto standard of plantation establishment.<span class="citation" data-cites="knowyourforest_tree_2020">(KnowYourForest 2020)</span></p>
<blockquote>
<p>However, as pointed out earlier, close proximity of male and female gametes of opposite mating types is not sufficient to engage the fertilization process. Unknown factors, which remained to be discovered, are necessary for ascocarp initiation.<span class="citation" data-cites="le_tacon_certainties_2016">(Le Tacon et al. 2016)</span></p>
</blockquote>
<p>In vitro culturing might be problematic:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>However, after passing through repeated subculturing, aging mycelial cultures tend to lose the ability to establish mycorrhitic associations (Thompson et al., 1993; Roth-Bejerano and Kagan-Zur, unpublished), which severely limits their useful life. What is needed is a way of speeding up mycelial propagation and growth. <span class="citation" data-cites="ventura_mycorrhized_2006">(Ventura et al. 2006)</span></p>
</blockquote>
<p>The answer: Hairy root cultures!</p>
<blockquote>
<p>These results suggest that mycorrhized transformed roots could be the key to an improved system for the production of inoculated seedlings.</p>

<p>I got the fungi environmental control system working. Two DS18B20 temperature sensors measure the intake air and wet-bulb temperature. An AM2320 humidity/temp sensor measures the interal environment humidity and temperature. The humidity is controlled by heating the water in the humidifier via relay board and 200 watt immersion heater. Everything is written in python on a RPi Zero W.</p>
<p><a href="/assets/src/fungiController-0v1.py">version 0.1 source code</a></p>
<p>Some of the first attempts at attaching leads to the sensors failed for some reason. Maybe I will come back and figure out the problem (I suspect it was just faulty soldering on my part), but for now I just made other ones. I used old USB cabling instead of phone wire. The wire is bigger and stiffer, but that just makes it easier to solder and strip.</p>
<p>Anyway… now I have the fungi controller printing out environment conditions via ssh. I wouldn’t normally include fungi stuff on a plants page, but all of the environmental control systems are going to be in service of plants in the near future.</p>

<p>I also installed the <a href="https://psychrometrics.github.io/psychrolib/api_docs.html">psychrometrics library</a> for easy conversion. The formulas aren’t that complicated and I could write some out to avoid the overhead of the entire library if necessary. https://cals.arizona.edu/azmet/dewpoint.html</p>
<p>For 1-wire sensors, less than 5 meters of cable really don’t matter. I am using 4-conductor telephone wire because it’s basically free. I will get some rj-11 connectors and jacks. They are super cheap.</p>

<p>Incubator still seems to be working. The temperature fluctuates at least +-2C. Gotta work on those environmental control systems.</p>
<p>Since I don’t have a mini USB keyboard, I tried to setup <a href="https://raspberrytips.com/pi-zero-setup-without-keyboard/">wireless networking and ssh directly on the SD card</a>. I also added static IP info to <code>/etc/dhcpcd.conf</code>.</p>
<p>For some reason that didn’t work, so I hacked together a female USB to male micro USB cable to plug in a keyboard to the pi. Then I reflashed the SD card and booted the right now.</p>
<p>Wifi signal isn’t great. I keep getting get errors. The mylar sheets that line my grow closet and stand between me and the router probably don’t help…</p>

<p>Started with full strength MS media + MES (commercial mix) + 8g/l agar + 20 g/L table sugar. The media didn’t completely dissolve even after heating to &gt;80C. I poured 30g in 9 1/2 pint jars while swirling to maintain the suspension. The jars are topped with two layers of craft felt and jar lids with 5 1/8&quot; holes (my standard fungi lids). I will pressure cook them at 15psi 121C for 15 minutes to see if everything dissolves appropriately.</p>
<p>I will start with 5 seeds each of Echinopsis langeniformis, E. pachanoi, E. “Serra Blue” X E. pachanoi Monstrose, Lophophora diffusa, and Sceletium tortuosum.</p>
<p>MES concentration 1 g/L (5.1 mM). pH 6.2</p>
<p>It seems that agar melts at +85C, so perhaps I needed to heat the media just a bit more. <em>Yep… that was the problem. Heating to 95C worked.</em></p>
<p>Weird that I haven’t faced this problem before. Perhaps it’s the pH.</p>
<p>Well the first 5 species are incubating. My sterile technique leaves something to be desired. I forgot to include a surfactant in my bleaching solution. I started steriling the seeds before my sterile water had autoclaved, so I had to improvise some using syringe filters. One of the seeds dropped into the waste beaker during rinsing. I used a bent paperclip to transfer seeds to agar. I definitely put nonsterile items in front of sterile ones.</p>
<p>All in all, I give this a 50% chance of any of the jars surviving without contamination.</p>
<p>Jars are incubating in an aquarium with specially designed filter lid and placed on a seedling heat mat. Full power to the mat results in &gt;30C temperature, so I have it plugged into a variac at 40% power right now.</p>
<h2 id="may-2021-15">07 May 2021</h2>
<p>L. diffusa:</p>
<ul>
<li>full strength MS + 8 g/L agar + 20 g/L sucrose (no PGRs)</li>
<li>adjust to pH 5.7</li>
<li>10 seeds per dish</li>
</ul>
<p>Planted the wasabi rhizome today. The box it arrived in was severly crushed, but it appears to have survived. The rhizome was planted in a recycled kratky planter filled with hydroponic media (mostly LECA with some river pebbles). Media was PC’d for 15 minutes and the container was washed with bleach prior to use. Twice a day I drench the rhizome with cold tap water until water runs out of the drain hole in the base.</p>
<p>I ordered more tiny fountain pumps. Hopefully I can use them for a more permanent solution. I can’t decide whether I want a DWC or drip system.</p>

<p>Aaaaannnddd there’s another choice for IoT boards: ESP32. They appear to be a better choice. Integrated wifi. ADCs and DACs. uPython support. The only downside is their lack of display and SD card support unless you want to pay 4x more for the dev board versions which have that support.</p>
<p><a href="https://docs.espressif.com/projects/esp-idf/en/latest/esp32s2/hw-reference/esp32s2/user-guide-saola-1-v1.2.html">ESP32-S2-SAOLA-1R‎ (Rover)</a></p>
<p>You can also buy SD card modules for less than $1. They are basically just breakout boards that connect to the ESP32 via SPI.</p>
<p>https://randomnerdtutorials.com/esp32-microsd-card-arduino</p>
<p>Thinking about culture containers… I like the idea of temporary immersion. Perhaps a coarse charcoal puck at the bottom of the container would work? It could be compressed and bound using a biodegradable glue (perhaps gelatin based). Sort of an in vitro support material like a flood drain hydroponic system.<span class="citation" data-cites="hoang_effects_2020">(Hoang et al. 2020)</span> Charcoal would be a natural alternative to vermiculite, perlite, or other non-renewable media. This system would be optimized for the rooting phase. Unless we are talking about a rotating/rocking system…</p>
<p>Ultimately, the customer will receive a wrapped plant suitable for indoor/outdoor planting. If the culture container could double as a shipping container, that would be awesome. The top could be removed after sterile culture and contain more permanent/expensive parts like tubing and connectors.</p>
<p>Temporary immersion would require some sort of binder to keep the support media from surrounding the plant. The RITA culture system uses a built-in filter to separate the liquid from the plants.</p>
<p>There might be a different style container for woody plants: They can’t just float around and bend to root in any direction. There has to be a balance between friability of the substrate and strength.</p>

<p>If I can sterilize containers with vacuum hydrogen peroxide, then I can simultaneously sterilize liquids in a continuous, high-temperature short-time process.</p>
<p>https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/engineering/continuous-sterilisation</p>
<p>Agar might present a problem. At RT, it is solid or undissolved. Either mixing or separate heating might be necessary. Unless we are using liquid media without agar… <span class="citation" data-cites="tienne_temporary_2002">(<span class="citeproc-not-found" data-reference-id="tienne_temporary_2002"><strong>???</strong></span>)</span></p>
<p>Some old design equations. <span class="citation" data-cites="deindoerfer_principles_1958">(Deindoerfer and Humphrey 1958)</span></p>
<p>Unfortunately, this precludes things like grain jars for mushrooms since they can not be sterilized by either of these methods. It might be a possibility in the future, however.</p>
<p>What containers? For short cacti, petri dishes can be used.</p>

<p>RPi controlled pressure cooker was looking to be an easy project until I looked at steam solenoid valve prices. They cost more than my pressure cooker. I might be able to get away with some $50 models designed for less demanding steam systems. We aren’t talking nuclear reactor steam vessel here. Just 200kPa at 121C.</p>
<p>I could, of course, manually vent the pressure cooker during the initial warm-up phase. And that is probably what I will do. Complete automation is only reasonable with larger systems.</p>
<p>What about a stepper/servo motor turning a regular valve?</p>

<p>In preparation for my ten day trip, I have secured almost all of the plants in kratky hydroponic containers. Only the succulents and trees remain in soil.</p>
<p>I also turned the lighting down to a minimum. This feature is super nice for keeping the plants from using too much water while I’m away.</p>
