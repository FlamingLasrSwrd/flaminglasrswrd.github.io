<p>Iâ€™ve been constructing a test version of the microreactor using a few scavenged HPLC pumps. It consists of three inputs. Two are mixed together before the third is added. It is designed to be operated in a coolant bath.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, HPLC pumps are not perfect. They definitely canâ€™t be used for nitration studies.</p>

<p>Project Created!</p>
<p>Iâ€™ve probably looked through 30 eBay pages trying to find 1/16&quot; stainless steel tubing. My acceptably small result list of 712 items from this eBay search string:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>SS tube -fitting -NPT -fittings -elbow -union -3/8 -1/2 -3/4 -5/8 -adapter -nut -clamp -connector -plug -gauge -MNPT -US -gauges -beer -sleeve</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I was still looking for teeâ€™s and crosses so I left those in the search.</p>
<p>I finally stumbled across the Waters line of tubing for HPLC. The reason I didnâ€™t find it before is that Waters labels their tubing in thousands of an inch, not the customary fractions (e.g.Â 0.062&quot; instead of 1/16â€œ).</p>
<p>Anyway, now I have a decent supply available of longer SS tubes that donâ€™t cost hundreds of dollars (for 50 meter increments).</p>
