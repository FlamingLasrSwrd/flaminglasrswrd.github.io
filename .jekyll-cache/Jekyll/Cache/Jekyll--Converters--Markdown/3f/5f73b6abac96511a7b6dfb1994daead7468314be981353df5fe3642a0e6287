<p>A handlheld clothing steamer is just about perfect for the job and can be had for a few dollars at a second hand store. When sanitizing an area, fill the reservoir with 30% hydrogen peroxide and plug in the device. Spray down your container when the element is fully warmed. Be warned: a small amount of H2O2 may be left in the element from previous uses and can spray without warning during heat up. Alsoâ€¦ donâ€™t use the vaporizer to steam your drapes afterwards.</p>
