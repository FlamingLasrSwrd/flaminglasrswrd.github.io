<p>Part one covers the basic testing characteristics of the GRE: How it is set up, and how it is scored.</p>
<h3 id="ch.-1-introduction-to-the-gre">Ch. 1 Introduction to the GRE</h3>
<p>The GRE has three section: Verbal Reasoning, Quantitative Reasoning, and Analytical Writing. Each section has its own testing methodology which is discussed in detail in the following sections.</p>
<h3 id="ch.-2-multi-stage-test-mechanics">Ch. 2 Multi-Stage Test Mechanics</h3>
<p>The Multi-Stage test adaptively controls the difficulty level of the second test in each section. The better a test taker performs on the first section, the greater their score potential will be. This effectively provides a score floor/ceiling based upon the first test of each section. The effects of the Multi-Stage test are not known to the test taker, therefore, it is best to simply ignore this information when it comes to taking the test.</p>
