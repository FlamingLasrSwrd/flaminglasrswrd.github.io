I"¢<h1 id="summary">Summary</h1>
<p>I am slightly obsessed with productivity. In the past, I have used â€˜how I feltâ€™ about my productivity as the primary endpoint instead of actually measuring it. In the last month, I have committed to finding at least some measure of my productivity that is objective. Since I do almost all my work nowadays on the computer, monitors that track my activity there are a good start. So I choose to activate RescueTime and logkeys. I am also participating in a <a href="https://www.trackyourhappiness.org/">Harvard doctoral study</a> that sends me thrice daily surveys on my happiness and some factors that might be related. Hopefully these data will lead to some interesting correlations that I can later test. Supplementation is probably a big player here and I have yet to devise a passive way to measure that. Still working on untracked productivity such as any project in the real worldâ€¦</p>
<h1 id="logkeys">Logkeys</h1>
<p>Install Logkeys using the <a href="http://launchpadlibrarian.net/165012984/logkeys_0.1.1a+git5ef6b0dcb9e3-2_amd64.deb">.deb file here</a>. I couldnâ€™t figure out how to get logkeys to start on boot. The service kept giving errors about the existence of a keyboard device even though I checked it many times. It turns out that logkeys doesnâ€™t follow links. Rather than use <code>DEVICE=/dev/by-id/platform-i8042-serio-0-event-kbd</code> in <code>/etc/default/logkeys</code>, I should have been using where that linked to: <code>DEVICE=/dev/input/event4</code>. Now it starts up great. A note: since logkeys starts before the home directory is decrypted, you must put your keymap in a system folder. Now my keymap is in <code>/etc/default/keymap</code> with the logkeys default set to <code>KEYMAP=/etc/default/keymap</code>. I also had to change the DAEMON_OPTS line in <code>/etc/init.d/logkeys</code> to <code>DAEMON_OPTS=&quot;-s -d $DEVICE -o $LOGFILE -m $KEYMAP $DAEMON_OPTS&quot;</code>.</p>
