<h2 id="sunday-aug-27-2017---weekly-review">Sunday, Aug 27, 2017 - Weekly Review</h2>
<p><strong>Before:</strong> Today is the day I plan my next three months to four years. My goal is to get into grad school next fall. How do I get there? What do I need to change? Lots of questions. Very few answers at the moment.<br />
<strong>After:</strong> Quite a few things were answered today. I looked into KU‚Äôs research into AI and there basically isn‚Äôt any. I need to prep for the GRE. The Dept of Linguistics has a 50th anniversary in a few weeks. That looks fun. I would like to find more colloquy to attend.<br />
<strong>Time Spent:</strong> 3 hrs</p>
<h2 id="mon-aug-28-2017---moocs">Mon, Aug 28, 2017 - MOOCs</h2>
<p><strong>Before:</strong> Massive Open Online Courses will be the subject of today‚Äôs research. I need to find some classes to start on. I could, of course, just learn these things on my own, but for a number of reasons MOOCs are better. Today‚Äôs work will be cut short since I have to travel home at 3pm to return my brother‚Äôs car.<br />
<strong>After:</strong> I spent way too much time with the car ordeal. I created the <a href="/active/2017/08/28/MOOC/">MOOC</a> page.<br />
<strong>Time Spent:</strong> 3 hrs</p>
<h2 id="tue-aug-29-2017---gre">Tue, Aug 29, 2017 - GRE</h2>
<p><strong>Before:</strong> The GRE is a major contributor to my scholastic success and proof of such. How do I prepare? Last time I took it (2012) I did not prepare and I didn‚Äôt do so well.<br />
<strong>After:</strong> I found a workbook provided by Kaplan. I shall work through it and if I have time I will also work through an additional ‚ÄúMath Workout for the GRE‚Äù book. I also finished my research on MOOCs and decided that I must become proficient in Python before anything else. I spent some time on this site as well. I can‚Äôt believe I still have all this stuff from previous projects.<br />
<strong>Time Spent:</strong> 8 hrs</p>
<h2 id="wed-aug-30-2017---researchers">Wed, Aug 30, 2017 - Researchers</h2>
<p><strong>Before:</strong> The whole goal of grad school is to learn more about AI. I can start that research now and accomplish some of my grad application goals at the same time. Today I should focus on defining my research goals and finding some others who have the same.<br />
<strong>After:</strong> I think I am more confused. AI just isn‚Äôt specific enough. I thought I would just be looking at CS programs, but now I have to look at cognitive and brain sciences too.<br />
<strong>Time Spent:</strong> 6 hrs</p>
<h2 id="thu-aug-30-2017---website">Thu, Aug 30, 2017 - Website</h2>
<p><strong>Before:</strong> Need to work on the site. Its horrendous.<br />
<strong>After:</strong> It‚Äôs less horrendous.<br />
<strong>Time Spent:</strong> 6 hrs</p>
<h2 id="sun-sep-3-2017---back-on-the-wagon">Sun, Sep 3, 2017 - Back on the Wagon</h2>
<p><strong>Before:</strong> I fell off the wagon. Let‚Äôs get back to it. Over the weekend I did a few hours of work on the site and some AI work, but not very much. Mostly I spent time watching Youtube :( Today I would like to set up some structure to my days.<br />
<strong>After:</strong></p>
