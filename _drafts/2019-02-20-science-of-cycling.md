# Intro
Earlier today I was explaining to my roommate the physics of why a heavier person is at a disadvantage cycling up a hill but has an advantage on the downhill slope. After twenty minutes of explaining the various factors, she remarked on the lack of information in this area and the rampant misinformation. We decided that a YouTube channel devoted to explaining the science of cycling would be hugely beneficial to the racing community.
