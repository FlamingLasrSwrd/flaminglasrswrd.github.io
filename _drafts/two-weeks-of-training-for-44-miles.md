  I have two weeks to train for a 44 mile charity race. I'm gonna science the shit out of this.

This is going to be difficult. For the last two weeks I have gotten zero exercise. Before that I only ran 3-5 miles once a week. I am a fairly heavy guy (83kg).

# Work Log

## 09 Apr 2019
I am no longer afraid of traversing stairs.

## 07 Apr 2019
Completed the run: 38 miles out of 44 with an average of 14 minutes per mile. Everything hurts right now. I probably could have walked the rest of the way just to finish, but the race coordinators were all waiting on me so I decided to call it early. 

## 08 Apr 2019
Followed the glycogen superloading protocol. I was able to consume about 75% of my target carbs.

## 05 Apr 2019
Ran on a treadmill for 1 hr at my target race speed of 5mph. It felt good. I anticipate some trouble with chaffing.

## 27 Mar 2019
Yesterday I collected data to estimate my VO2_max. I ran on a treadmill at 8.0mph until my heart rate stabilized to about 182 bpm. Using equations and the table mentioned earlier, I determined that my VO2_max was approximately 42 ml O2 per minute per kg. Not bad... but not great. Slightly above average for my demographic. Using equation 1 from that same paper I estimate that I will consume 8 kcal per minute running at the slowest pace possible (~5 mph; 65% of my VO2_max). The entire 44 miles race completed in just under 9 hours would require 4200 kcal. Of which, 2000 kcal of carbohydrate is required. I'm starting to be optimistic of my chances of finishing this race...

- delta_p = 28

For superloading glycogen, I will be following the protocol set out in [@fairchild_rapid_2002]. Namely, 5 minute warm-up, 150 seconds at 130% VO2_max, 30s all out sprint on a stationary bike, and carbohydrate rich foods starting 20 minutes after exercise totaling 865g over 24 hours.

After running these calculations, it seems that injury will likely be the limiting factor. I once attempted to "run" 50 miles wearing [rubberized socks](https://www.instructables.com/id/Barefoot-Running-Plasti-Socks/) instead of regular running shoes. I had been using a similar pair of rubber socks for months without issue. In fact, they helped cure my ankle protonation. For some reason, however, after about mile five the socks had almost completely worn away. I was essentially running barefoot on gravel/paved roads. I made it to a total of 24 miles before I called one of my friends to pick me up. I definitely won't be wearing rubber socks for this race.

Looking into rapid carb loading protocols [@fairchild_rapid_2002] and the metabolic requirements of a long races [@rapoport_metabolic_2010].

> The anaerobic processes, hydrolysis of phosphocreatine and conversion of glycogen to lactate, produce at most 73.3 and 39.1 mmol ATP s-1, respectively; by contrast, the aerobic processes, which involve the complete oxidation of muscle glycogen, liver glycogen, or adipose-tissue-derived fatty acids, produce at most 16.7, 6.2 or 6.7 mmol ATP s-1, respectively [25]. The maximal rate of ATP extraction tends to decrease as the size of the fuel reservoir increases.

A 44 miles race requires (at max) 5800 kcal to complete (for me). The human body only stores 3000-4000 kcal of glycogen in muscles and the liver at the best of times. Half that in the untrained individual. So I will have to carb load and probably consume food throughout the run.

This "race" has a time limit of approximately 13 min per mile.

Metabolic substrates: increased utilization of (rate limited) fat will decrease utilization of (amount limited) carbohydrate substrates. I have plenty of fat on my body for several ultras. I only have enough carbs for 23 miles or so. If I could raise my fat utilization I can preserve the limited glycogen and thus run longer. This can be accomplished by running slower (not an option), or by training the body to use fats more effectively. HIIT cannot help here.

I need to estimate my factors:

- HR_max ~= 207 - 0.7 * age
- run at 8 mph on treadmill until heart rate stabilizes
- use Fig 4 to estimate VO2_max
- velocity_max from Eq 3 [@rapoport_metabolic_2010]
- substrate utilization rate at race velocity

One major problem I encountered during my last attempt of this magnitude was boredom. My performance definitely decreased when my audiobook ended. I will need to find something to listen to.

Overheating is also a significant issue for me. Water and ion loss will be important to consider.

> running at a constant speed, as assumed in the present discussion, is the most metabolically efficient pacing strategy for completing an endurance race in a given time. [@rapoport_metabolic_2010]
