> I believe that every human (and some of the more cunning monkeys) can and should be provided the necessities of life. That includes (but is not limited to) food, shelter, and a dab of social inclusion. Any metamotivations beyond that are up to the individual. -Post to Facebook 2017-11-06 Elijah K. Dunn

 Every human, by merit of being human alone, should be protected from starvation and exposure. That protection should come from those who have more than those basic requirements.

I exclude all other forms of life apart from humans without justification. The existence of apes and amoebas alike might very well deserve protection. Certainly, by protecting human life we might coincidentally protect other forms, e.g. the microbiome.

How might we implement such a system? Short answer: I don't know.

# An Argument from Eudaimonia

Does wealth redistribution create additional wealth?

**Let us examine a simple, binary example:**

Aliens have suddenly and unexpectedly deposited a box which will cure all the world's diseases forever. The aliens simultaneously distributed one remotely connected switch per person across the Earth with only a single switch capable of activating the machine. All the world has to do is flip their respective switches and the box will cure all disease. In this scenario, the switches could be handled by monkeys and the result would eventually be the same. This is a case of uniform distribution of wealth with complete interchangeability. No quality of the recipient or any random shuffling of the switches will affect the outcome.

Now imagine that instead of switches, the aliens distribute a token which must be deposited into the machine for it to activate. Similar to the first scenario, only a single token will activate the machine and it is unknown who possesses the token. In this case, the distribution is even (any one person has an equal chance of their token activating the machine), but the end result is contingent upon a single quality of the recipient: their location. The further a token is away from the machine, the greater the required capital to deposit their token into the machine. The solution which minimizes the capital required would be to deposit tokens according to their proximity to the box.
