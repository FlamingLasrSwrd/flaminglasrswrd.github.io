Had a recent run-in with jealousy. Therefore, a more thorough evaluation of jealousy is warranted to determine its place in modern humans.

Previously, I had cursorily determined jealousy and the associated feelings, envy and malice, to be unnecessary and apragmatic.


Fetishes are a useful cover up for negative emotions. Lust and sexual desire is one of the most powerful emotions for us: Capable of overriding just about any negative feeling.

For example, most humans have an innate disgust for bodily excreta such as urine or feces. This feeling could be a natural side effect of evolutionary history since exposure to those excreta carry a higher risk of disease or harm to the individual. Perhaps this is not so much the case with urine (being mostly sterile), but it is unlikely to be a net positive for nutrition or health in general.

Wingman is ok because I am, in part, responsible for the outcome and therefore share the joy in its bringing. In my particular case, jealousy is multiplied by the acute knowledge that only random chance was involved in the event.


As my attachment wanes to the girl, so does my jealousy.

Jealousy could have been useful at a time when the genetic lineage of offspring could not be determined with absolute certainty. Without such assurances, a priori fierce defense of your breeding rights and partners was the only way to guarantee that the expense of raising a child was not in support of another's genetic preservation.

As alluded to earlier, genetic testing of children is commonplace today. Similarly, birth control and abortion can negate any risk of unwanted pregnancy. Combined, these facts make the genetic preservation defense of jealousy untenable.

This is all in service to the broader goal of my intellectual life, which is to evaluate the usefulness of various emotions in modern life.
